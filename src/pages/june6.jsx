      hi shravani,

i’m writing here because every normal channel is closed and i don’t want you to think i just disappeared. your mom called me this morning and asked me not to message you again. i dont know why but i wont because your devices might be with her but i still want you to know what’s on my side of the story.

truth is, i don’t even know why things blew up or what your parents have been telling you about me. i only know how much i value this and we built for a year, and i don’t believe anyone else gets to decide whether we can still talk or be friends. will they tell this to everyone who tlks with you?

if you’re seeing this, you don’t have to explain anything right now—i understand you’re in a tough spot. all i’m asking is a tiny sign that you’re okay. a short “i’m fine,” a thumbs-up through a friend, anything. once i know you’re fine and we two are good, i can wait peacefully until we’re both back at rose and can figure this out face-to-face.

until then, take care of yourself. i’m rooting for you, no matter what.
