      hi shravani, very important - i am very sick for the last 3 days. After talking to your mom my bp shot up but my bp isn’t going down and it's getting worse. If your phone is with you, please find a way to text me, please! i need it to get better. we dont need to make this big and take it to ur parents again.
      i am very sorry for everything! i have infinte amount of faith & trust in you and i am sure u will contact me. we all do dumb things and then forgive eachother, i am sure we will too if theres anything at all. <br />

i don’t want you to think i just disappeared.i don’t even know why things blew up or what your parents have been telling you about me. She called me and said u two are talking marriage so end this right here. I dont understand whats wrong in being friends as we have been for the last year. Breaking this up has already started taking a lot of toll on my health and im sure it must have happened to you as well and career.
all i’m asking is you to say that we are okay. Be it directly to me or any of mine or ur friends. Rmr my chats with ahaan where i talked about you?
